How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?

We write programs, with lots of comments, white space where needed and using modules or functions to simplify it and this all makes it more readable, adaptable, and maintainable. It was very helpful to have the CRUD be seperate as then you were less overwhelmed in the orignial code and makes it easier to make adjustments without having to searcg through a bunch of code. 


How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?

Being a computer sceincist has helped since i can start at the beginning of a problem or requirement and build up from there. It has also taught me to be more thoughtful with how often we save and how often we test. All of the techniques have helped me to understand all that is needed when creating a database. 


What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?

Computer scientists all work to find a solution to a clients problem, typically through a program they code. Being able to help a company solve a problem like Grazioso Salvare, would mean that they can work better and faster. This company is particular would have an updated list of animals it could look into training so that they can help more people in the future. It already has the animals and kinds it wants but sifting through animal shelters manually would take a very long time.
